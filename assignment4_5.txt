Perform the below operations:
1. Compute the measures of central tendency for salary and reduction which variable has highest center?
   Ans:
      central tendency is the measure of 
      1. Arithmetic mean
      2. Geometric mean   
      3. Harmonic mean
      4. Median
      5. Mode

   central tendency for salary

    >library(psych)

    > mean(data1$salary)
     [1] 724.5164
    > median(data1$salary)
     [1] 710.15
     #mode
    > y=table(data1$salary)
    > names(y)[which(y==max(y))]
     output shows all values because there are no repeated salaries
    > geometric.mean(data1$salary)
     [1] 709.5975
    > harmonic.mean(data1$salary)
     [1] 694.7747

   central tendency for reduction

    > geometric.mean(data1$salary)
     [1] 709.5975
 
    > harmonic.mean(data1$salary)
     [1] 694.7747
    > mean(data1$reduction)
     [1] 223.631
    > median(data1$reduction)
    [1] 139.5
    > geometric.mean(data1$reduction)
    [1] 141.0917
    > harmonic.mean(data1$reduction)
    [1] 68.25501
    #mode
    > x=table(data1$reduction)
    > names(x)[which(x==max(x))]
     [1] "116"

    >densityPlot(data1$reduction)
    >densityPlot(data1$salary)

    >hist(data1$reduction)
    >hist(data1$salary)

  by seeing te histogram or densityplot of salary and reduction we can find that there 
  is no skewness in salary so we can take center as mean
  and right skewness in reduction  so median as center

    > median(data1$reduction)
    [1] 139.5
    > mean(data1$salary)
    [1] 724.5164
hence salary has highest center

2. Which measure of center is more appropriate for before and after?


>library(RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR)
    >View(RcmdrTestDrive)
    >data(RcmdrTestDrive)
    >names(RcmdrTestDrive)
    >data1<-RcmdrTestDrive

    >hist(data1$before)
    >hist(data1$after)

  by seeing histogram we can see skewness for after and normal distribution for before

   so mesure of center is more appropriate for before.
